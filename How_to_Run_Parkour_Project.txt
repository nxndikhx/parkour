# How to Run the Parkour Smart Parking System

## Step 1: Clone or download the project files
Make sure you have the complete folder structure including:
- main.py
- parkour/(folder containing all modules)
- venv2/ (your virtual environment)

## Step 2: Activate the virtual environment
On Windows (PowerShell):
    .\venv2\Scripts\activate

## Step 3: Install required dependencies (if not already installed)
Make sure the following are installed in the virtual environment:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

If requirements.txt is not available, install individually:
    pip install numpy==1.24.4 pandas opencv-python easyocr torch matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn networkx qrcode pyzbar

## Step 4: Run the main program
    python main.py

## Notes:
- If you encounter any NumPy version compatibility issues, use:
    pip install numpy==1.24.4

- If you encounter permission errors with torch DLLs:
    Close other running Python processes and try again.

- Make sure your datasets are in the correct location (inside the project directory).

## Dataset Files Expected:
- updated_parking_slots_dataset.csv
- user_authentication_dataset.csv
- vehicle_information_dataset.csv

Happy Parking! ðŸš—
